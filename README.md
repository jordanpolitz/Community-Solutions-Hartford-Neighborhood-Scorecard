# Community-Solutions-Hartford-Neighborhood-Scorecard

IMPORTANT: May may take up to a minute (60 seconds) to load. There are several thousand points plotted on the map.

Map Overview: This map allows the viewer to compare different vulnerability indicators for each of Hartford's Neighborhoods. Select polygons from the drop-down to see a color coded comparison (by neighborhood) of each indicator. Select another indicator, from the list of indicators with check boxes, to overlay as points ontop of the polygons. Indicator normalization is described in the pop-up window that appears when a neighborhood is clicked on. Color coding and "scoring" is determined by the quartile that each neighborhood's normalized indicator value falls into.

Reflection: This map could be more meaningful if a "threshold" were to be determined for each indicator. Currently, "high vulnerability" scores are "high" because the score is higher than all of the other scores. We would like to know if the score is actually indicating vulnerability or simply ranking each neighborhood.
